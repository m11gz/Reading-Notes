Review API Server Build
Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter. It is very important to know when to use Query Parameter or URI Parameter while designing an API. URI parameter (Path Param) is basically used to identify a specific resource or resources whereas Query Parameter is used to sort/filter those resources.

What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

Domain: http://our-site.com
v3
model name: stuff
id: things
API: http://our-site.com/id

We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
Review Auth Server Build
Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth. The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret (see RFC7616 and RFC7617). The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by the RFC6750.

Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth. OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.

Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend. An organization assigns a role-based access control role to every employee; the role determines which permissions the system grants to the user. For example, you can designate whether a user is an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user, and limit access to specific resources or tasks.
