*How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?* An object would be something like a cells to a body. They can comprise of multitudes of variables strings and arrays. 
*What are some advantages to creating object literals?* Object literals are much more efficient than sending several items individually.
*How do objects differ from arrays?* Objects are a data type that is mutable and can store multiple types of data. An array is a variable and it can hold multiple lists of values. 
*Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.* if an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value
*Evaluate the code below.* What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? It refers to the object that it is inside of. It saves a lot of time especially if you have several lines of code. It can save time and space. Good for clean code. 
*What is the DOM?* Document Object Model 
*Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.* The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.
