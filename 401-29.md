useReducer hook

Name an alternative to the useState Hook. As opposed to calling useState , call useReducer with a reducer and initialState , as shown below. The useReducer call returns the state property and a dispatch function.

Why might the useReducer Hook be preferable to the useState Hook? useReducer provides more predictable state transitions than useState , which becomes more important when state changes become so complex that you want to have one place to manage state, like the render function.

What are two ways to set the initial state? There are two main ways to initialize state for your application. The createStore method can accept an optional preloadedState value as its second argument. Reducers can also specify an initial value by looking for an incoming state argument that is undefined , and returning the value they'd like to use as a default.
