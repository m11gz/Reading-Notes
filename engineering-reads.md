# Notes

I learned that when it comes to interviews. Problem solving is the most important thing. Another fun fact I learned is not to focus on the syntax. Learn how to solve the
problem first and then it will be easier to learn the syntax. 

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

If I were to pretend that I were getting paid to study. It would guarantee that I work harder and more efficient. If I act like I get paid $1000 an hour you tend to waste 
less time and you are more cautious on what you give your time to.

# How to Solve Programming Problems
 
 When it comes to whiteboard intewviews or solving coding problems, it is easy to just dive right in. Instead of doing that. Think twice and act once. So your not wasting
 time. 
 
 Here are some pre-emptive steps
 
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.
