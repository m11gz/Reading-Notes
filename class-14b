What I was able to pick up from this reading assignment was to make sure to keep a good team with good communication. Our ability to treat our team mates with respect is
everything. Making sure you have employees with well kepy emptions and their comfort level to speak up and say
what is on their mind. Having a good leader that is able to see what their team needs is everything.
