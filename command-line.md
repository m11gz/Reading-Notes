The Command Line - I did not know that previously typed commands were stored in the command lines. That will defiently help out a lot. I always type it out. Saved time. yay. 

Basic Navigation - I know the assignemnt said not to do one liners. But this is basic. I have been doing this for the basics for the past two months. Not to sound braga-
docious. 

More About Files - I knew most of everything for this website. However the one thing that I learned was that everything is a file under Linux even directories.

Manual Pages - I do not have a lot of experience with manual pages. I will be using this in the future. ----> man <command to look up>. I also learnd to exit out of manual pages all you need to do is press cntrl q.

File Manipulation - I also know most about this website. However I do not have a lot of experience removing directories. I will be sure to use rmdir. I also learned that 
moving files is also an option. Will be using this often. 

Cheat Sheet - Not much to be said for the cheat sheet. Very self explanatory. But I have bookmarked this website. Will for sure use in the future.
