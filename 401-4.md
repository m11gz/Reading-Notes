nosql vs sql

What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment? For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don't have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage? The type of data to be stored : SQL databases are not suitable for hierarchical data storage. However, the NoSQL database is better suited for hierarchical data storage because it follows the key-value pair method or graph method. NoSQL databases are highly preferred

Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them? The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can't have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one.

Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships. separate

Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key. t is unique column in every table in a database It can ONLY accept;

nonduplicate values
cannot be NULL Foreign Key: It is a column that comes from a different table and using Foreign key tables are related each other It is the primary key of another table It can be duplicate or null for another table

How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax? The SQL keyword MODIFY is used to change the structure, properties or constraints of a table. Data values to be added to a table are specified by using the SQL VALUES clause.

Define normalization within the context of schemas and data. The goal of normalized schemas is to avoid storage of duplicate data so that stored data can't become inconsistent. Because tables with a normalized schema don't contain duplicate data, they are highly suitable for supporting transactions in which data is inserted, updated, and deleted.

Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

What is the difference between one-to-one one-to-many and many-to-many relationship? One-to-one: A record in one table is related to one record in another table. One-to-many: A record in one table is related to many records in another table. Many-to-many: Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.
