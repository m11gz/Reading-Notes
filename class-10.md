# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.** Syntax error would be spelling errors in your code which will render it useless. Logic error means you didn't put in the right code. You will have correct syntax which will make it a lot more difficult to debug.

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.** I have gotten both wrong and it happens 
frequently. I have to go over it and think about how I could have done it wrong. If I mess it up and can't figure out what I did I will go over it with a teacher. 

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?** Be humble and admit you made a mistake. 

# The JavaScript Debugger.

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?** I would say it's amazing to start off with
by knowing what you did wrong and how you did it you are able to avoid making mistakes in the futre, hopefully. 

**Define what a breakpoint is.** It is used to halt your code while you debug. 

**What is the call stack?** It shows what is excucted to current line. Pauses on breakpoint.
