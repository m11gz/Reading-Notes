Readings: Authentication
Securing Passwords

Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password. Storing passwords securely is a recurring concern. But what are the main methods, how do they work, and what are they worth against current password cracking techniques? In this article we explain the main principles of secure storage (hash, salt, pepper, iteration) and highlight their importance for resisting password recovery methods. Finally, we will talk about a reliable hash function for secure storage.

What is Bcrypt? is a password-hashing function

Why might you use something like Bcrypt? bcrypt allows building a password security platform that can evolve alongside hardware technology to guard against the threats that the future may bring, such as attackers having the computing power to crack passwords twice as fast.

Basic Auth

What is Basic Authentication? In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.

What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?

Basic Auth
Bearer Token
API Key
Digest Auth
OAuth 2.0
Hawk Authentication
AWS Signature
How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded? is encoded in Base64

OWASP auth cheatsheet

Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter. Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is. Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server.

How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why? An HTTP response contains: A status line. A series of HTTP headers, or header fields. A message body, which is usually needed. A response that represents an error or failure, either from a non-successful HTTP status, an error while executing the request, or some other failure which occurred during the parsing of the response.
