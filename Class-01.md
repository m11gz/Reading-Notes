I feel that most important lesson in all these links is to get started with your basics. To know what they are, and how to utilize them. A good analogy is, imagine 
building a Jenga tower. If you were to build your Jenga towers with two blocks or really questionable wood material it's going to fall apart. It might stand for a couple
minutes but the more blocks you add on top the higher chance of it falling down.

but be wary outside if foggy.
