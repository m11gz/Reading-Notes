Implementation: Linked Lists
To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

Use an analogy
Explain a detail in depth
Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
Tutorial / walk through an example
Write a quiz
Create a vocabulary/definition list
Write a cheat sheet
Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
Build a map of the information
Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

Big O notation - apparently, the 'O' in big O stands for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation.

Big O is used to classify algorithms by their run time or space requirements.

Running time - (time complexity) How long does this function need to complete its task?

Memory Space - (space complexity) How much computer memory resources will this function use to store data and computer instructions? "How efficient is our space consumption?"

Big O's purpose is to describe a function's worst case scenario.

Here are the 4 Keys Areas to consider when thinking of Big O:

Input Size
Units of Measurement
Orders of Growth
Best Case, Worst Case, Average Case
n Input Size: The size of the parameters read by the function.

Units of Measurement - quantify with:

time in milliseconds (more useful checking the performance on specific hardware)
number of operations (number of lines of code fun from start to finish)
number of basic operations (usually the innermost loop)
Memory Space - four sources of memory usage:

the space the lines of code itself takes to run the algorithm

the space that the input data needs

the space needed to hold the output data

the space needed to hold working data during run time (stack space, recursive calls)

Orders of Growth - the order of magnitude that time and space requirements go up by when the size of the Input n increases

Orders of Growth Log Plot

How do we analyze big on with pen and paper?
